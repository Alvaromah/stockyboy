# Stocky Boy
Stocky Boy is a pygame developed for the [DevPost Pygames Hackathon 2023](https://pygames.devpost.com/). The game pays homage to the classic 8-bit games from the 1980s. Our goal was to create a game that is easy to pick up and play while remaining challenging and addictive. With retro-style graphics inspired by comic books and manga cartoons, coupled with music that transports players back to the golden age of gaming, Stocky Boy delivers an immersive nostalgic experience.
